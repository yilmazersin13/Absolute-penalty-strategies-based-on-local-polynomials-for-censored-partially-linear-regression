# Absolute-penalty-strategies-based-on-local-polynomials-for-censored-partially-linear-regression

This repistory is formed by three .R scripts to realize the Monte-Carlo Simulation study, that are
(i) Functions.R: It involves the functions of the proposed Local polynomial estimators based on absolute penalty functions for partially linear models. If one wants to get the results of the simulation study, Functions.R should be Run firstly.
(ii) Simulation_Study.R: This script makes the simulation study. Researchers can change the certain parameters to obtain a different simulation scenarios such as censoring level, smaple size and also, functions allows to choose a different penalty functions. 
(iii) Design_Resutls.R: This file produce the final results and plots and it works based on the obtained results from the Simulation_Study.R.

As a summary, one should Run codes with the given order above.
